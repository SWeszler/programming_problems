# Programming Problems
by Sebastian Weszler

## Techniques
1. Analyse solution on paper.
2. Big picture first, then details. If this is large problem break down into smaller functions, separate algorithm from data structure. Use known data structure.
3. Communicate your thoughts, speak about it. Make sure all your assumptions are correct.

## Arrays
1. Most frequently occurring item in the list.
2. Common elements in two sorted lists.


## Strings


## Graphs (two-dimensional arrays)


## Linked Lists


## Trees
