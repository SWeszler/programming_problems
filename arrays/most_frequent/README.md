# Most frequent occurring item in array

NOTE: we are using lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.

Find the most frequent occurring item in array.
Example: the most frequent occurring item in array [1,2,3,1,3,1] is 1

If you are given empty array you should return None.

You can assume that there's always a single unique value that appears most frequently unless array is empty. For instance, you won't be given an array such ass [1,1,2,2].

## Testing

```
pytest ./ -vv
